# Outlier Detection Definitions

In the book Data Mining Concepts and Techniques, (Han, Kamber, Pei, 2012), the authors mention three types of outliers: global outliiers, contextual( or conditional) outliers, and collective outliers. 

1. Global outliers, are data objects that deviate significantly from the rest of the data set. 
2. Contextual outliers, are data objects that deviates significantly from the data set with respect to a specific context of the object. Contextual outliers are a generalization of local outliers, which refers to density-based outlier analyis approaches. 
3. Collective outliers, refers to a subset of data objects (as a group) that deviate significantly  from the entire data set.
